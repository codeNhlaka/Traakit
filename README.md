<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Traakit v0.02-alpha

Traakit is still a small Software but has potential to grow to something users find usuable and impactful.
The app aims to do all the productivity work for you while on a job hunt. 
While actively applying for a job to different companies, the one most important thing is to keep up with all the 
daily applications you've sent out. This is important because of many reasons but one that affects most is scammers. 
Knowing which company you applied to and when helps your understand whether such application does exist in your record history
whenever you're being called for an interview.

Traakit helps you traak(track) and manage all your applications. You can create a record of an application and update it whenever there is a new change to it, 
whether it's an offer, interview or rejection. 
Traakit will watch over all your activity and give your a summery of rejected, pending and total applications.

Of cause there are extra features that helps simplify your life when it comes to tracking and managing applications, such as `Documents`
which allows you to store copis of your Resume or Cover letters. And as time progresses, we'll add more features that improves the app and make it be a must have.
